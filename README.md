This project is based on another project, project Winlator Glibc-Frost here is the page to the emulator: https://github.com/MrPhryaNikFrosty/Winlator-Frost, with this application we are going to run "TUNIC"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why did we chose "Winlator" and not another emulator on witch the game was released ?

- One of the options was "Yuzu"emu. the game ran well BUT, the app is set to overclock the CPU, so ther was a good performance only if you set the ressolution to 0.25 witch kills the look of the game.
- NOTE:Becaus e the CPU is set to overclock, so 

- There were more switch emulators but for the reason
